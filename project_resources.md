## Push Your Luck
* Link: https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-push-your-luck
* Primary Source
* This resource is a simple math game, similar to what I want to develop, with a visually appealing graphical user interface.
* A wheel with slots numbered 1-12 is spun. Users play against a series of computer opponents. Each round, all players place a bet on whether the wheel will land on an even or odd space. If a player guesses correctly, they are awarded a number of points equal to the number the spinner landed on. At any time before a round starts, players have the option to stop betting and bank their points. The first player to reach 100 points wins.
* I intend to use a fun, colorfun UI that inspires and attracts younger users who have less developed mathematical understanding or skills. This web app utilizes these features.

## 2048
* Link: https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-2048
* Primary Source
* This resource simply has users utilize the arrow keys to move all numbered blocks on a grid in order to combine same numbers. The objective is to combine numbers to reach 2048. The lowest numbered block is 2, therefore developing users understanding of exponentiation on the number 2.
* I like the simplicity of the gameplay and the overall minimalist UI that is used.

## heXsum
* Link: https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-hexsum
* Primary Source
* This is another resource from CoolMathGames. The goal is to fill the grid with the right numbers in each row and column. When you see an arrow outside the board, the tiles that the arrow is pointing at must add up to the number on the arrow. When you have it right, the arrow will turn green.
* I like the simple interface utilized, as it isn't distracting and lends focus to the actual objective of the game.

## Batteries Inside
* Link: https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-batteries-inside
* Primary Source
* Users click and drag the circular plugs from the batteries to the light bulbs. Each light needs a certain amount of voltage, that must match the sum of the numbers on the batteries.
* I enjoy the simplicity of the game. I think it is very straightforward, but still teaches about basic mathematical principles in an interactive way for younger students to better develop quantitative reasoning skills.
