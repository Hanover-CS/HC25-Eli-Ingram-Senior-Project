# KittyQuest: A Feline Fishing Fable

## Project Description
### Basic Features

### Description
KittyQuest is a simple pixel-art-based platformer, in which the player embarks on a journey to find all the fish! Each level ends by navigating through the maze and finding the coveted salmon filet. Players will dodge enemies, avoid hazards, and solve the puzzle of finding the salmon filet. Players can choose their kitty from a small selection of coat patterns (usable skins) to personalize their KittyQuest experience. Each level will (hopefully) have a different background, giving the illusion of exploring different areas.
