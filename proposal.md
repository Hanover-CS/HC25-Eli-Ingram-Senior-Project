# KittyQuest: A Feline's Adventure for Fish

## Project Description
### Description
KittyQuest is a simple pixel-art-based platformer, in which the player embarks on a journey to find all the fish! Each level ends by navigating through the map and finding the hidden salmon filet. Players will dodge enemies, avoid hazards, and solve the puzzle of finding the coveted *salmon filet*. Players can choose their kitty from a small selection of coat patterns (usable skins) to personalize their KittyQuest experience. Each level will have a different background and map layout, giving the illusion of exploring different areas that each offer a new puzzle to work through. 

### Basic Features
* Start Menu (Start, Continue, Level Select, Player Icon Selection?)
* Multiple Levels (Current *Goal*: 3-5) 
* Info Checkpoints (explaining basics of how to play)
* Enemies/Hazards/Traps
* Collectible Fish objects with score tally
* Defined endpoint for each level (you found the salmon filet!)

#### Feature Purposes
* **Menu**: provides users with a way to continue progress made previously, and choose customizable features
* **Levels**: offering a selection of levels will give more variety to the gameplay experience
* **Checkpoints**: offers users with helpful hints and tips throughout gameplay
* **nemies/Hazards**: creates a more difficult and interesting experience
* **Collectibles**: offers some guidance to where endpoint is located
* **Score Tally**: allows users to gauge their progress on the current level
* **Endpoint**: the levels have to end somewhere

## Similar Solutions
1) Capybara Quest:
Capybara Quest (1) is a web-based platformer game in which the user navigates through the map to collect the yuzu fruit. There are enemies present that, when interacted with too closely, will result in restarting the level. There is no capability to destroy enemies, as capybaras are peaceful creatures. I want to implement a similar system, in which players are unable to damage enemies, but enemies are able to hinder the player's progress. Capybara Quest also utilizes cute pixel art and a simple background/platform theme, making it simple and effective at setting a tone for the game. 

2) Le Chat Fonce:
Le Chat Fonce (2) is another simple web-based platformer game. In this game, players explore the map to collect blue sprites and find various pieces of a key in order to move onto the next level. This game does not feature any enemies environmental hazards, giving it a focus on exploration and figuring out where all the necessary key pieces are. I want to implement some sort of an item for players to collect, similar to the sprites. I also want to implement some form of puzzle element, such as finding a specific item to move onto the next level. The lack of hazards and enemies makes for a simpler gameplay, but it is still enjoyable trying to find all the pieces of the keys throughout the somewhat complex maps.
