# Setup

### Step 1: Complete 'Getting Started with Phaser'
- Complete all the steps to [this walkthrough](https://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started-phaser3).
- Note that part of the walkthrough involves choosing an editor. You are free to choose whichever you would like, but for simplicity I recommend using WebStorm as that is what I am using to create this tutorial.


### Step 2: Download Initial Code & Assets
- Download these [provided files](./assets.zip) and open the "file_name_here" file as a New Project in WebStorm.


### Step 3: Run & Test
- To ensure the startup code is working properly, run the program and be sure that it opens in a web browser window.
- Play around with the sprite for a while and make sure there are no major bugs that are apparent.
