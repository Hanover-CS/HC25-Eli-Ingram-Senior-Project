# Setup

### Step 1: Complete 'Getting Started with Phaser'
- Complete all the steps to [this walkthrough](https://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started-phaser3).
- Note that part of the walkthrough involves choosing an editor. You are free to choose whichever you would like, but for simplicity I recommend using WebStorm as that is what I am using to create this tutorial.


### Step 2: Download Initial Code & Assets
- Download these [provided files](./assets.zip) and open the "phaser3-tutorial-src" file as a New Project in WebStorm.


### Step 3: Run & Test
- To ensure the startup code is working properly, run the "part6.html" file in your web browser and be sure that it opens in a web browser window.
- Notice that the character sprite is unresponsive to keyboard inputs, i.e. the sprite is stationary. This will make for a pretty boring platformer - we should add some functionality to enable keyboard inputs.
