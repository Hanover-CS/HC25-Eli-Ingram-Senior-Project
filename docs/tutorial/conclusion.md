# Conclusion 
Now that we have enabled keyboard inputs, we have a very basic game running. We utilize a cursor object to listen for keyboard inputs that then dictate which direction the player sprite moves. This allows players to interact with the sprite, but there's not much else to it. This is great, but maybe you want to add a few supplementary features to make the game more interesting. 

## Extra Features
If you're feeling like challenging yourself a bit more, here are some ideas for extra features for you to implement on your own! 

### Create Star Objects
It would be nice if there were something for players to do besides jump from platform to platform. Lets add some collectibe star objects for players to grab!

### Keeping Score
Now that players are able to collect items in game, maybe they want some way to account for the items they have collected. Lets create a score tally that updates whenever more stars are collected.
